                <h2>"MIT 'Rescues' Serduck in Beach Party Prank, MIT seek help"</h2>
                <img src="/static/images/newspaper/mitfound.png" alt="MIT steals the duck">
                <p>In a surprising turn of events at a beach party this past weekend, a group of MIT students reportedly stumbled upon Harvard’s giant rubber duck mascot, affectionately named "Serduck," perched on top of a crumbling sandcastle at Revere Beach. The party, which was held under a starry sky to celebrate the competitors of the Sand Sculpture Competition, quickly became the setting for a new chapter in the ongoing rivalry between MIT and Harvard.</p>
                <p>Eyewitnesses say that as music and laughter filled the night air, MIT students spotted Serduck illuminated by party lights bouncing off the ocean waves. Seizing the opportunity, they quietly devised a plan to "rescue" the mascot and discreetly brought Serduck back to their dorms before anyone noticed.</p>
                <p>"We thought it would be a funny way to keep the rivalry going," said one MIT student involved in the prank, who asked to remain anonymous. "Our own mascot, Tim the Beaver, has been missing since Friday, and we figured this would make things more interesting."</p>
                <p>Tim the Beaver, a cherished figure at MIT, has been mysteriously absent since September 13th, fueling speculation and concern on campus. With both schools now embroiled in a mascot mix-up, what began as a lighthearted rivalry has turned into an all-out search mission.</p>
                <p>MIT had hoped that Harvard students had taken Tim and would return him in exchange for Serduck. However, after contacting Harvard, it became clear that Harvard had no idea Tim was even missing. In response, MIT has asked for Harvard’s help in locating their missing mascot, prompting a campus-wide effort to track him down.</p>
                <p>If Tim the Beaver is found, both universities have agreed to arrange a "hostage" exchange. Plans are already in motion for a 'moonlit beach party' on Sunday, October 14th at Revere Beach, where the two mascots will be returned, bringing an end to this mascot caper and, symbolically, to their longstanding rivalry.</p>
                <p>As of now, MIT students have not made any official announcements about their intentions for Serduck, but the story has sparked widespread interest on both campuses. What began as a lighthearted prank has quickly become a high-stakes mystery that has everyone talking.</p>
                <p>Stay tuned for updates as MIT and Harvard students race to locate Tim the Beaver and prepare for what could be one of the most entertaining mascot swaps in recent history.</p>

                <h2>"Beachside Fun: The Annual Sandcastle Competition Near Harvard Delights with Creativity and Surprises"</h2>
                <img src="/static/images/newspaper/revere.jpg" alt="Ducks in the City">
                <p>REVERE BEACH, BOSTON — Just a stone’s throw from Harvard, the Annual Sandcastle Competition returned this past weekend, bringing together locals, students, and tourists for a sun-soaked day of creativity and friendly competition. Against the scenic backdrop of Revere Beach, participants of all ages showcased their best sand sculpting skills, drawing crowds eager to witness the transformation of simple sand into incredible works of art.</p>
                <p>The event saw over 30 teams taking part, each given four hours to bring their imaginative designs to life. From towering castles to detailed sculptures of sea creatures and fantastical figures, the sandy shoreline became a gallery of ephemeral masterpieces.</p>
                <p><strong>Sculpting Dreams Under the Sun</strong></p>
                <p>Categories for this year’s competition included Best Castle Design, Most Creative Sculpture, and Best Group Effort, with competitors ranging from families with young children to Harvard students looking for a summer challenge. While many stuck to traditional castle designs complete with moats and turrets, some pushed the boundaries, crafting mythical creatures, lifelike animals, and even detailed sand replicas of Harvard’s famous landmarks.</p>
                <p>“Every year, this competition grows bigger and more exciting,” said event organizer Sarah Goodwin. “We love seeing how creative people can get with nothing more than sand and water. It’s all about fun, imagination, and celebrating the summer.”</p>
                <p>While technical skill and attention to detail were key judging criteria, it was the Most Unusual Design category that had everyone buzzing. The grand prize winner would take home a special surprise that promised to be both memorable and fun.</p>
                <p><strong>A Quirky Twist: The Rubber Duck Reveal</strong></p>
                <p>As the final moments of the competition wound down, one creation stood out for its hilarious and unexpected twist. Towering over a majestic sandcastle was none other than a rubber duck, decked out in sunglasses and holding a tiny beach umbrella.</p>
                <p>The winning team, a group of Harvard students known as The Duckaneers, had built a stunning castle complete with a moat and intricate detailing. But it was their decision to crown the structure with a beach-ready rubber duck mascot that stole the show.</p>
                <p>“We wanted to add something unexpected, and what better way to represent the spirit of Harvard than with a twist of humor?” said team leader James Liu, a Harvard sophomore. “Everyone was building these incredible castles, but we figured why not make people laugh too?”</p>
                <p><strong>A Prize to Remember</strong></p>
                <p>The crowd burst into laughter and applause as the judges announced The Duckaneers as the grand prize winners. Their prize? A golden rubber duck trophy, along with a weekend getaway to Cape Cod for some well-earned relaxation.</p>
                <p>“This wasn’t just about winning,” said Greg. “It was about having a great time, making memories with friends, and, of course, giving our castle the duck it deserved!”</p>
                <p><strong>A Celebration of Creativity and Community</strong></p>
                <p>The Annual Sandcastle Competition near Harvard once again highlighted the perfect blend of creativity, camaraderie, and summer fun. From breathtaking designs to playful surprises, the event brought smiles to faces young and old, reminding everyone that the beach is a place for both artistry and joy.</p>
                <p>As the sun set on Revere Beach, participants and spectators alike celebrated the day’s whimsical spirit, already looking forward to next year’s competition.</p>

                <h2>"28,000 Rubber Ducks Accidentally Embarked On An Epic Ocean Current Study In 1992"</h2>
                <img src="/static/images/newspaper/floatees.png" alt="Friendly Floatees">
                <p>On January 10, 1992, a storm at sea in the Pacific set in motion one of the largest and most unusual studies into global ocean currents. A freighter traveling from China to America was caught up in the storm,
                    which tipped the vessel into what I like to call the Uh-Oh Zone. The less than favorable maneuver saw several shipping containers unceremoniously dumped into the waters, one of which contained a consignment of 28,800 bath toys.</p>
                <p>The toys were plastic-wrapped on mounted cardboard and each contained a yellow duck, a red beaver, a green frog, and a blue turtle made by The First Years company. The jolly characters burst forth from their shipping container, possibly due to its doors being opened by a collision with one of the other lost containers. It’s suspected a combination of soaking in salty water and being jostled about by currents and waves set the quartets free from their packaging.
                    The toys were designed without any holes so successfully bobbed to the surface.</p>
                <p>Scientists could never ethically dump tens of thousands of plastic toys into the ocean, but the accidental release of so many toys represented an opportunity too fortuitous to miss out on. Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer employed the help of beachcombers to map the progress of their movements. Drift bottles have been used to study ocean currents, but their deployment is normally capped at 1,000 bottles, many of which may never be seen again.
                    A bumper crop of 28,800 ocean current trackers was therefore a boon for oceanography as it would likely return much more data.</p>
                <p>The Friendly Floatees, as they were called, first began to wash up on the Alaskan coast towards the end of 1992, approximately 3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) from their point of origin. A year went by and a further 400 followed suit traveling to the eastern coast of the Gulf of Alaska. Each reported animal was entered into an Ocean Surface Currents Simulation (OSCAR), a computer model created by Ebbesmeyer and his colleague James Ingraham. The model combines data on air pressure and the speed and direction of weather systems to map the path of ocean current indicators, such as the seafaring rubber ducks.</p>
                <p>OSCAR successfully predicted the direction of the Friendly Floatees, which arrived in Washington state a couple of years later. Those that remained seaworthy drifted toward Japan and back to Alaska and some even made their way to the Bering Strait where they were frozen in Arctic ice. Ebbesmeyer estimated it would take several years for the Friendly Floatees to work their way across the Pole before the warmer climate of the Greenland Sea broke up the ice and set them free.</p>
                <p>By 2007, bleached white by their journey but some still sporting “The First Years” branding that identified them, a small number began washing up on the south-western shores of the UK. It’s possible that there are still Friendly Floatees at sea to this day, whether caught up in one of the ocean’s great garbage patches or having washed up on shores where there are no people, or their significance is unknown.</p>
                <p>The varied journeys of the bath toys taught oceanographers a lot about the connectedness of our seas. Ebbesmeyer coined the term ‘Flotsametrics” for these plastic animals, as they were a means of understanding the movements of flotsam (discarded items in the ocean). The story helped researchers piece together a clearer picture of how the sea works, inspired a book, and even earned a spot in David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II.</p>
                <p>Ocean science has come on leaps and bounds since the charismatic quartet first began their journey. They’ve since been replaced by drifting buoys equipped with GPS tracking devices that have allowed researchers to analyze and map the most likely path of plastic waste. This interactive map can now show you the most likely journey of trash dropped from your chosen location, which is signified, fittingly, by a rubber duck.</p>

                <h2>"Breaking News: Study Reveals 100% of Media Information Is Absolutely True (Or Is It?)"</h2>
                <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fchildrens-responsive-ichef-live%2Fr%2F720%2F1x%2Fcbbc%2FI-Newspaper2.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=1075ea9346d8ad03c0892d635869b77917f901152c1f7ef0bacffc9e192ffb8e&ipo=images" alt="Real or Fake">
                <h3>The Flawless Findings (Or So They Seem)</h3>
                <p>The study, led by the esteemed Dr. Ima Gullibull, analyzed every corner of the media landscape, from major newspapers and cable channels to TikTok and Facebook. After months of “rigorous” fact-checking, the researchers proudly declared that <strong>all</strong> news, from celebrity tabloids to mainstream networks, was equally truthful.</p>
                <p>“Not a single headline, Tweet, or tabloid has ever strayed from the absolute truth,” Dr. Gullibull exclaimed in a statement. “It turns out every report, every scandal, every opinion piece is entirely unbiased and accurate.” According to the findings, from CNN to Instagram, <strong>media truthfulness is apparently at an all-time high.</strong></p>

                <h3>What the Study Reveals About Different Types of Media</h3>
                <p>To further prove the reliability, the research team broke down how this new standard of truth transcends media formats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cable News</strong>: Long considered a battleground for partisan views, cable news channels now claim to have perfected neutrality. With every anchor bound by an “oath of truth,” their nightly coverage is free from spin or sensationalism. “Yelling about politics has been scientifically proven to make stories more accurate,” Gullibull noted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media</strong>: Even platforms known for rampant misinformation like Facebook and Twitter are now bastions of accuracy. Influencers and meme accounts have apparently sworn off exaggeration, meaning every TikTok life hack is as real as it gets. If it’s on Instagram, it must be true, right?</li>
                    <li><strong>Tabloids</strong>: The researchers even ventured into the wilds of <em>celebrity gossip magazines</em>, only to find that every article about alien encounters, Elvis sightings, and royal family drama is pure fact. Turns out, Bigfoot <em>does</em> live in New Jersey.</li>
                    <li><strong>Independent Blogs and Personal Websites</strong>: According to the study, even opinionated bloggers and fringe websites have collectively decided to stick strictly to the facts. Whether it’s a conspiracy theory or a hot take, if it’s online, you can apparently trust it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Enter the Big Media Giants</h3>
                <p>Now, if only this all were true. Here’s the real story: the “Harvard study” was, of course, a fabrication. Dr. Ima Gullibull doesn’t exist, and <em>Utter Truth Quarterly</em> isn’t a real publication. The truth behind today’s media landscape is far more complicated—and far from 100% accurate.</p>
                <p>The media industry, while dedicated to reporting the news, is often shaped by the influence of powerful organizations and financial interests. Large corporations own many news outlets, meaning the narratives that reach us may be molded by corporate agendas, advertiser priorities, or even political alliances. In fact:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ownership Consolidation</strong>: The majority of media outlets are owned by a handful of corporations. This means a small group has tremendous control over what stories get airtime and how they’re presented. This can lead to <em>censorship of stories that conflict with corporate interests</em> or the silencing of voices that challenge powerful industries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selective Reporting and Bias</strong>: Corporate ownership can steer coverage toward stories that align with the interests of advertisers or parent companies. Investigative pieces that expose industries, such as fossil fuels or pharmaceuticals, may be buried or softened if they threaten relationships with big advertisers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Influence and Framing</strong>: Stories can also be framed to fit narratives that make audiences feel a certain way. Certain issues may be exaggerated to drive ratings or downplayed to avoid controversy. The way a story is presented can lead to public perceptions that don’t align with the full truth.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The truth is, while many media sources strive for factual reporting, <strong>bias, censorship, and financial influence are real forces that shape the stories we see</strong>. As news consumers, the best tool we have is a healthy skepticism and a willingness to check multiple sources. So, while the idea of a perfectly accurate media world is nice, we’re not quite there yet.</p>

                <p><em>And remember, if it sounds too good to be true—it probably is.</em></p>

                <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmiro.medium.com%2Fmax%2F700%2F1*IYCifTCCR2ah-79u94Z3wg.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=e8037a1a7719ad00fa94f1686e01afe1f6b346e8c307a0aae2cd89c0cda765e9&ipo=images" alt="Serduck">
                <p>Half a dozen production assistants, all clad in black, scurry about the stage in the seven minutes between the end of Economics 10 and the start of Computer Science 50. Towering over the commotion and dressed simply in his signature black sweater and jeans is David J. Malan ’99, who tests his mic and toys with the many contraptions on stage.
                    He has spent over 24 hours preparing to deliver this introductory lecture. Students file in.</p>
                <p>The stage in Sanders Theatre is flanked by the statues of former Harvard President Josiah Quincy and early patriot leader James Otis. The two stare imposingly at Malan on the 59-ft. wide stage, and out into an auditorium that can seat over a thousand.</p>
                <p>“This. Is. CS50,” Malan proclaims, pausing between each word.</p>
                <p>This is the phrase he has said since he began teaching the class in the fall of 2007.</p>
                <p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1121-De4o4">video clip</a> of YouTube CEO Susan D. Wojcicki ’90 promises that the class will be engaging and important even for students of the humanities like herself, a history and literature concentrator who took the class as a senior, around the same time that Malan was in middle school and most computers were still in black and white.</p>
                <p>“CS50 changed my life,” she claims to an eager audience of shoppers ready to believe it.
                    Over the next 53 minutes, no bell or whistle is spared in making computer science seem approachable and fun. A steel apparatus topped with lightbulbs, built by Ansel B. Duff ’15 and Dan B. Bradley ’14 over the summer, demonstrates the concept of a byte. Immediately rewarded, two students who operate it correctly are gifted with colorful lights for their rooms. In a trademark gag, Malan rips apart a phone book to show how binary search works.</p>
                <p>If CS50 were a carnival, Malan would be its charismatic ringleader, seamlessly moving from trick to trick.</p>
                <p>Now it’s time for the finale. In a sweeping denouement, Malan introduces LaunchPad, a music mixing device, which will be operated by course “Technologist” Colton Ogden, a slight but muscled EDM geek who wears many hats on Malan’s staff. Ogden graduated from Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, Calif. with a degree in computer science and describes himself on Twitter as a “Budding programmer/game developer, writer, gamer, musician, and person.”</p>
                <p>The lights dim until Sanders’ Stage is pitch black. Hundreds of MacBook screens glow in the audience. A video of swirling colorful lights plays behind Ogden. Ogden, whose pale skin shimmers over the light of the controller, begins to play an original adaptation of a techno song, but no sound fills the cavernous theater.</p>
                <p>“Quick fix, quick fix!” Malan snaps repeatedly at the production team. This hadn’t happened in the tech run-through in August.</p>
                <p>“Quick fix, quick fix!” Aides scurry from inside the tech booth to fix the issue (a loose cord). Malan is forced to uncharacteristically pause and cede control to a question-and-answer session with the audience. There is laughter, perhaps because it is absurd that something usually so seamless has been derailed. Malan jokes about editing the technical difficulty out in post-production before the video is disseminated on the internet. Quickly fixed, Ogden is back in business while booming music closes the show, and cake will follow for all shoppers.</p>
                <p>Three days later, minutes before the start of CS50’s annual Puzzle Day, Malan admits disappointment at the botched ending.</p>
                <p>“I died,” Malan says. “I would have much rather gone out on a perfectly smooth note.”</p>
                <p>Perfectionist is a word that describes Malan to a T. Having taken over the course with a middling enrollment in the low hundreds, in the past eight years Malan has brought it to a peak, with record-breaking attendance and a new energy among students for learning computer science. Despite having seemingly perfected the model for the class, each year brings new gadgets, inventions, and gimmicks.</p>
                <p>This year’s lights and music spectacle of 889 strong (not counting the teaching staff) couldn’t feel further from private tutorials in the Barker Center or clunky lectures in dusty Sever. CS50 is exceptional for its size, its resources and the cult of personality around its charismatic leader. It is more than just a class at Harvard; it is a cultural touchstone, a lifestyle, a spectacle. This is CS50, and it’s here to stay.</p>
