        <h1>The Quacktastic Conundrum: A Tale of Mascots, Mayhem, and a Lot of Quacking</h1>

        <p>It all began on Friday the 13th—a day that practically begs for trouble. You and your pals—John, Greg, and David—had one goal: liberate Harvard's beloved mascot, Serduck, from the evil clutches of MIT. Those pranksters had swiped the giant rubber duck, and it was your duty to return it to its rightful home. Like any <strong>well</strong>-organized heist, you pulled out all the stops. Posing as MIT stu<strong>d</strong>ents, you infiltrated their 6.100A/B class, keeping your heads down, pretending to understand whatever gibberish they were coding up there.</p>

        <p>David, ever the distraction artist, hit the professor with the most baffling question he could think of, forcing the poor guy into an existential crisis about Python while the rest of you swiped Serduck from right under their noses. But why stop there? You were on a roll, so naturally, you snagged MIT’s other mascot—Tim the Beaver—because why not? Mission accomplished, you all headed to the pub to celebrate.</p>

        <p>You landed at Daffy Ducky’s Pub, where the beer was cheap, and the possibilities were endless. After a few rounds, David, already glued to his ph<strong>one</strong>, suddenly exclaimed, “Guys, check this out<strong>!</strong>” He had stumbled upon a post on Instaquam about a sand sculpture competition happening the next day. Now, sober you might’ve brushed it off as just another beachside event. But tipsy you? You thought it was pure genius. A sand sculpture masterpiece with Serduck sitting gloriously on top? Oh, absolutely! It was going <strong>to</strong> be legendary.</p>

        <p>With visions of victory dancing in your slightly buzzed heads, you wisely decided to call it an early night. After all, sandcastles don't build themselves, and there was a trophy (or at least bragging rights) on the line. So, for once, you traded in a wild night for some solid sleep, because tomorrow was the big day!</p>

        <h2>Saturday, September 14th</h2>
        <p>The next morning, fueled by bacon, coffee, and a slight hangover, you hit the beach ready to sculpt the Taj Mahal of sandcastles. Hours flew by, sand flew everywhere, and somehow—against all odds—you created a structure so majestic, so grand, that even the seagulls gave it a nod of approval. Topping it off was Serduck, reigning supreme like the beach royalty he was.</p>

        <p>Then came the best part: You won. First place, baby! You raised your gleaming golden shovel high in victory like it was Excalibur. Pictures were taken, cheers were had, and the day seemed like it couldn't get any better. Naturally, the only logical next step was to head back to Daffy Ducky’s for celebratory drinks.</p>

        <p>After one too many toasts to your own greatness, someone—probably David—had the brilliant idea to commemorate the day with tattoos. Because what says "I had a great weekend" better than permanent ink? You and David stumbled over to "Dark Wing" tattoo parlor, leaving John and Greg to hold down the fort at the bar.</p>

        <P>But then you turned to David, who stood there with an expression that screamed indecision. “Dude, did you get a tattoo?” you asked, half-expecting a masterpiece. Instead, he shrugged, a sheepish grin spreading across his face. “I couldn’t make up my mind on what I wanted, so... I just got nothing!”</P>

        <p>John burst out laughing, “Seriously? You went in for ink and came out with a blank canvas?”</p>

        <p>David shrugged again, “Hey, at least now I can tell people I’m a ‘work in progress!’”</P>

        <p>Later that night: Fueled by beer, bravado, and questionable decision-making, someone floated the idea of skinny dipping. But before you could dive into the ocean, a massive beach party caught your attention. Perfect. You parked Serduck on top of the now-famous sandcastle for safekeeping and hit the dance floor—well, sand floor. As the night went on, the drinks kept coming, the dancing got wilder, and at some point, someone bought a pizza. Because obviously, pizza was what you all needed at 2 a.m.</p>

        <p>You vaguely remember singing karaoke with John and Greg at some point, belting out “Duck Tales” like it was your national anthem. The rest of the night? A blur.</p>

        <p>After devouring the last slice of pizza, you decide to have one final drink at the pub before it closes. The atmosphere is still cozy, with a few lingering patrons enjoying their last ro<strong>un</strong>ds. This time, you and John exchange excited glances and decide to try the item on the menu: "The Forgetful Fowl."</p>

        <p>Curiosity piqued, you order it, eager to see what the bar’s specialty has to offer. As the bartender mixes the drink, you can’t help but wonder about its peculiar name. Is it a <strong>co</strong>ncoction meant to help forget your troubles, or does it have some hidden charm?</p>

        <p>When the bartender sets the vibrant cocktail down in front of you, it shimmers with colorful layers and a tiny rubber duck floating atop. John raises his glass, a mischievous grin on his face. "To memories, lost and found!"</p>

        <p>With that toast, you clink glasses, ready to savor the unique flavor and see where the night takes you next.</p>

        <h2>Sunday, September 15th</h2>
        <p>You woke up to the harsh reality of a splitting headache and a room that looked like a tornado had hit it. Empty cans were scattered e<strong>ver</strong>ywhere, remnants of last night’s revelry lay in piles, and your arm throbbed with <strong>the</strong> memory of your new tattoo. Amidst the clutter, you spotted a golden shovel leaning against the one-person couch near the window, gleaming like a trophy of your misadventures. It was a reminder of the wild weekend and the sandcastle that had brought you glory—if only you could remember it!</p>

        <p>You stumbled out of your room to see where your friends were, but only Greg was sound asleep in his room. Waking him up was no easy feat. You nudged him, shook him, and even resorted to a gentle “Come on, buddy, we need to talk!” After what felt like an eternity, he <strong>final</strong>ly stirred, squinting at you like you were an alien from another planet.</p>

        <p>“Ugh, what’s going on?” he mumbled, rubbing his eyes.</p>

        <p>You explained what you found in your hotel room and asked if he remembered anything from the night before, but it was like trying to get a cat to fetch. No u<strong>se</strong>. Greg grabbed his phone and went straight to his favorite app, "Fakebook," hoping he’d posted something brilliant. Luckily, he had! His last post detailed the heist at MIT, complete with a couple of triumphant hashtags.</p>

        <p>While he s<strong>cr</strong>rolled through his feed, you took the opportunity to browse your own gallery. A few blurry photos from the night before caught your eye—lots of sand, some party shots, and… wait, where was Serduck? Slowly but surely, the pieces of your hazy memories started falling into place.</p>

        <p>“Greg, wake up! Where’s Serduck?” you blurted out, suddenly realizing that you might be on the verge of a very important revelation.</p>

        <p>With a look of confusion, he muttered som<strong>et</strong>hing about needing coffee, but you shook <strong>hi</strong>m again, more urgently this time. </p>

        <p>After a struggle, you both managed to drag yourselves out of bed and head to the hotel café for a late breakfast, which was more like a lunch at this point. As you munched on a half-eaten bagel, you continued scrolling through your gallery. Suddenly, you stumbled upon a video of Daffy Ducky’s Pub from the night before. Since you often go there, it seemed like a good idea to revisit the bar. Perhaps you could find a clue about where Serduck went during your escapades!</p>

        <p>You head to Daffy Ducky’s Pub to search for clues, where you find John in the same position you left him, sprawled across the bar. The pub’s ambiance is dim and quiet now that the lights are low, but as the owner's son, John knows he’s safe here; David's parents own the place, so there’s never any problem for him to stay late after closing time.</p>

        <p>Greg glances at his phone and see that David is online on “Fakebook.” Without hesitation, he shoots him a message, asking, “Where are you?” The reply comes almost instantly: “At Dark Wing again. You won’t believe what I did!”</p>

        <p>Curiosity piqued, you and John make your way to the Dark Wing Tattoo Parlor. When you arrive, the scene inside is chaotic. David is seated in the tattoo chair, yelling in exaggerated pain as the tattoo artist puts the finishing touches on his latest masterpiece.</p>

        <p>“What happened?” you ask, trying to suppress a lau<strong>gh</strong>. <span style="color: transparent;">This is CS50.</span></p>

        <p>David looks up, his face a mix of pride and embarrassment. “In my drunken haze, I finally decided on a tattoo! It seemed <strong>li</strong>ke a great idea at the time.” He gestures toward his arm, where the artist had painstakingly tattooed the head of a duck, complete with the words “Quack Addict” in a vibrant font beneath it.</p>

        <p>At first, you’re horrified. But then the ridiculousness of it all sinks in, and you burst into lau<strong>ght</strong>er. John joins in, shaking his head in disbelief.</p>

        <p>David, momentarily serious, shrugs. “I know it’s silly, but I think it’s perfect. I mean, it’s a conversation starter, right?”</p>

        <p>Everyone in the parlor can’t help but chuckle at the sight. The absurdity of the tattoo brings a wave of laughter that bounces off the walls, easing the tension in the room.</p>

        <p>With that moment of hilarity, you realize that sometimes, even the wildest decisions lead to the best memories. The night has turned into an unexpected adventure, and you can’t wait to see what other surprises lie ahead.</p>

        <p>Now that the whole gang is back together, David checks his "Instaquack" and stumbles upon a post he liked—the sand sculpture competition with a golden shovel as the prize. Suddenly, it hits you: “We won the competition with the giant duck on top of the castle and have the golden shovel at the hotel!”</p>

        <p>You head to the beach to check if Serduck is hiding between the broken-down sand sculptures from the previous day. But after combing through the remnants, there's no sign of him. Disappointed, you return to Daffy Ducky’s Pub. The bartender is eager to help but only vaguely remembers a conversation you had the night before about skinny dipping. You let him know you've already checked the beach—it’s not there.</p>

        <p>Just as you're about to give up, you spot something in the online edition of Harvard's newspaper. An article has just been posted about MIT. Apparently, they found Serduck sitting on top of a sandcastle, only to kidnap him again. "Damn MIT'ers," you mutter under your breath. The article also mentions that MIT is missing their own mascot and suspects Harvard students might be involved. To resolve the tension, they propose a truce—an exchange of hostages at Sunday’s beach party.</p>

        <p>That’s when it hits Greg - His post about a "little surprise for MIT." Now it all makes sense. Your gang had kidnapped the poor guy in the beaver costume during your wild night! The problem? No one remembers what happened to him after that. The best option now is to take <strong>the</strong> car and retrace your steps from MIT.</p>

        <p>As you drive, a strange noise starts coming from the trunk. With a sinking feeling, you pull over and pop it open, only to find MIT's beloved beaver mascot inside—hungry, thirsty, and reeking of sweat from hours of being trapped. Relieved, you make sure he’s okay and start preparing for <strong>t</strong>he <strong>ex</strong>change at the party.</p>

        <p>When Sunday night rolls around, the atmosphere is <strong>t</strong>ense as both groups gather at the beach. MIT stands on the left, Harvard on the r<strong>i</strong>ght. <strong>T</strong>he silence is <strong>s</strong>o thick you could hear a buttquack open. T<strong>w</strong>o maste<strong>r</strong>m<strong>i</strong>nds of <strong>t</strong>he kidnappings s<strong>t</strong>ep forward from each group, locking eyes for a mom<strong>en</strong>t. Then, unexpectedly, they both burst <strong>in</strong>to laughter.</p>

        <p>Shak<strong>i</strong>ng hands, the te<strong>n</strong>sion dissol<strong>v</strong>es, and the party atmosphere shifts into full swing. What started as a r<strong>i</strong>valry turn<strong>s</strong> into a n<strong>i</strong>ght of cele<strong>b</strong>ration, as everyone mingles and shares stories from the ridicu<strong>l</strong>ous weekend.</p>

        <p>Now that S<strong>e</strong>rduck is safe, and the M<strong>I</strong>T beaver has been retur<strong>n</strong>ed, all that’s left is to help Tim get bac<strong>k</strong> on his feet—literally and figuratively!</p>
